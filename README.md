# myoEdison
Python module to interact with myo armband developed for Intel Edison

The class is still under development but you can find a working example in the examples directory.
The appilcation relies on the bluepy library that can be found here: **https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy.git**. 


This software has not been fully tested so use it at your risk (if yo send incorrect parameters to the armband the classifier can be reseted and you will need to install again the firmware).
